This file gives a high level overview of recent changes.

Revision 1.5

  WARNING: this update may break existing code.  We now use C++11 to
  build.  In addition, we have changed the interface of
  brick::common::Expect.  See below for more information.

- Made static data members of brick::common::Expect into static member
  functions to avoid the static initialization order fiasco.
  Code that previously looked like this:
    common::Expect::FormatFlag flags = common::Expect::SkipWhitespace;
  must be changed to look like this:
    common::Expect::FormatFlag flags = common::Expect::SkipWhitespace();
- Added a first whack at a CMake build system.
- Switched over to using C++11.
- Added a complex number class to stand in for the soon to be available
  std::complex class template.
- Added some more constants in constants.hh.

Revision 1.4

- Fixed a compilation error due to missing include directive in 
  compileTimestamp.hh.
- Updated splitFraction() function template to tolerate a wider range
  of types.
- Added rough first whack at a version number class to handle "X.Y.Z"
  style version numbers.

Revision 1.3

- Increased the precision of constants in namespace
  brick::common::constants.

Revision 1.2

- Added shorter names for integral sized types (Int8, UInt8, etc.).
- Fixed an issue with switchByteOrder() that led to incorrect results when
  the beginning and ending byte orders were the same, and the result was
  _not_ being generated in-place.

Revision 1.1

- Minor update: added arcTangent2() function template.

Revision 1.0

- Created brick::common by adapting dlr::common version 2.3a3.
