/** @file RELEASE_NOTES.TXT
This file gives a high level overview of recent changes.

Revision 1.7

- Added routines for reading and writing color PNG images.
- Added beginIteration() member function to RansacProblem class. 

  WARNING: This change will break any customer code that uses 
           RansacClassInterface, but does not derive from RansacProblem.
           If this applies to your code, simple add an empty member 
           function, void beginIteration(size_t) to your problem class.

Revision 1.6

- Refactored CameraIntrinsics class heirarchy.
- Added new class CameraIntrinsicsRational.
- Minor updates to KeypointSelectorBullseye.
- Other minor cleanup.

Revision 1.5

- Added function estimateProjectedAreaAndCentroid() to facilitate
  camera calibration with circular fiducials.
- Added function writePPM16() and added a sanity check to writePPM8().
- Minor cleanup.

Revision 1.4

- Minor feature additions to the RANSAC class interface and camera 
  calibration functions.
- Many updates to KeypointSelectorBullseye class and KeypointBullseye classes.
- Corrected a bounds error in getHistogram().

Revision 1.3

- Updated build files.
- Added very slow KeypointSelectorBulleye class (to be improved later).
- Fixed failing KeypointMatcherFast unit test.
- Fixed failing KeypointSelectorHarris unit test.
- Corrected compile issue in connectedComponents_impl.hh.
- Other minor changes and updates.

Revision 1.2

- Added implementations of three-point, five-point, and eight-point algorithms.
- Added FloatType template parameter to camera intrinsics classes.
- Added a weighted version of registerPoints3D().
- Added routines for stereo rectification and camera calibration.
- Added Felzenswalb's superpixels segmentation, and a disjoint set
  implementation.
- Added KdTree implementation.
- Added ImageWarper class to allow transforming images.
- Added basic morphological and image processing operations.
- Added extended Kalman filter implementation,
- Added very basic deformable models class (NaiveSnake).
- Made some updates to image fltering code.
- Added Harris corner detector implementation.
- Added (still incomplete) ICP implementation.
- A few other minor bugfixes and updates.

Revision 1.1

- Added classes and functions relating to camera intrinsics from
  dlrComputerVision version 2.4b3.  Many more still to come.

Revision 1.0

- Created brick::computerVision by adapting dlrComputerVision version 2.4b3.
