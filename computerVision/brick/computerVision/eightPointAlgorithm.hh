     * This function implements the "eight point algorithm"[1] for
     * recovering the fundamental matrix of a pair of cameras from a
     * sequence of at least eight pairs of corresponding image points.
     * That is, it recovers the matrix F, such that
     *
     *   transpose(u') * F * u = 0
     *
     * where u is a homogeneous 2D point in the first image, u' is a
     * homogeneous 2D point in the second image, and the symbol "*"
     * indicates matrix multiplication.
     *
     * This implementation implements the input transformation
     * described in [2] to improve the numerical stability of the
     * result.
