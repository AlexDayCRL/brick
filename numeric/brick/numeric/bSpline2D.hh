     ** Warning: This class is very new, and its test suite is
     ** incomplete.  It almost certainly contain bugs, and its
     ** interface may change.
     **
     ** This class template implements a bicubic 2D B-spline.  Other
     ** orders (e.g., biquadratic) are currently not supported.  This
     ** class is templated on control point type so that you can, for
     ** example, create a spline with 2D or 3D values by specifying
     ** control points of type Vector2D or Vector3D.  Note that the
     ** splines represented by this class are all 2D in the sense that
     ** you can represent them using a parametric function of two
     ** parameters.  If you want a spline that maps to a 1D parametric
     ** function (such as a curve in 2D or 3D space) you need to use
     ** the similar class, BSpline.  BSpline2D currently only supports
     ** non-periodic splines, and currently only supports uniform node
     ** spacing.  For now knot multiplicities are fixed at 1, meaning
     ** that folds and discontinuities are not supported.
     **
     ** The second template paramter, FloatType, controls the
     ** precision with which internal calculations are carried out.
     **
     ** This class implements the 2D spline used by
     ** ScatteredDataInterpolater, which is an implementation of the
     ** scattered data interpolation algorithm of Lee, Wolberg, and
     ** Shin [1].
