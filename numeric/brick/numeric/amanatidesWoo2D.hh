    /**
     ** This class implements the Fast Voxel Traversal Algorithm of
     ** Amanatides and Woo [1] for 2D arrays.  The algorithm is for
     ** efficient ray tracing through regular grids.  For convenience,
     ** there are two coordinate systems associated with this class:
     **
     ** - The pixel coordinate system is an integer-based coordinate
     ** system associated with the array.
     **
     ** - The world coordinate system, which can differ from the pixel
     ** coordinate system only by translation, rotation, and
     ** non-isotropic scaling, but is in other respects arbitrary.
     **
     ** The pixel coordinate system has its origin at the corner of the
     ** 2D array, has its first coordinate (which we'll call U) parallel
     ** to the rows of the array, and has its second coordinate (which
     ** we'll call V) parallel to the columns of the array.  As you move
     ** along any row of the 2D array, the transition from the first
     ** column to the second occurs at U == 1.0, the transition from the
     ** second column to the third occurs at U == 2.0, and so on.
     ** Similarly as you move along any column of the array, the
     ** transition from the first row to the second occurs at V == 1.0,
     ** and the transition from the second row to the third occurs at V
     ** == 2.0.
     **
     ** Once constructed, you can use the AmanatidesWoo2D class to
     ** access pixels along a straight line through the 2D array using
     ** STL-style iteration.  That is, the member functions
     ** AmanatidesWoo2D::begin() returns an iterator which references
     ** subsequent pixels along the line, and will become equal (==) to
     ** the iterator returned by AmanatidesWoo2D::end() when the line
     ** passes out of the 2D array.  Here's example usage:
     **
     ** @code
     **   typedef AmanatidesWoo2D< Array2D<int> >::iterator awIterator;
     **   Transform2D<double> pixelFromWorld;
     **   AmanatidesWoo2D< Array2D<int> > rayTracer(
     **     myArray2D, pixelFromWorld, rayOrigin, rayDirection, false);
     **   awIterator iterator0 = rayTracer.begin(); 
     **   awIterator iterator1 = rayTracer.end();
     **   for(; iterator0 != iterator1; ++iterator0) {
     **     *iterator0 = 0;
     **   }
     ** @endcode
