/** @file RELEASE_NOTES.TXT
This file gives a high level overview of recent changes.

Revision 1.3

- Added missing namespace qualifiers, allowing tests to build under recent 
  versions of g++.

Revision 1.2

- Fixed compile issues in transform3DTo2D.hh and rotations_impl.hh.
- Added TypeConverter class to support generic conversion between numeric types.
- Other minor updates and features.
- Added, but disabled, a unit test for nonperiodic B-Spline, based on
  feedback from Eric Kratzer.  This test exercises an issue with the class
  that has not yet been fixed.

Revision 1.1

- Added all remaining symbols from dlrNumeric.

Revision 1.0

- Created brick::numeric by adapting dlrNumeric version 2.3a4.
  WARNING: Several types (Vector2D, Vector3D, Transform2D, ...)
           now have additional template parameters.  This will
           make porting dlrNumeric code a little annoying.
