This file gives a high level overview of recent changes.

Revision 1.1

- Added all remaining symbols from dlrNumeric.

Revision 1.0

- Created brick::numeric by adapting dlrNumeric version 2.3a4.
  WARNING: Several types (Vector2D, Vector3D, Transform2D, ...)
           now have additional template parameters.  This will
           make porting dlrNumeric code a little annoying.
