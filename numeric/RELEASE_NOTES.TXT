/** @file RELEASE_NOTES.TXT
This file gives a high level overview of recent changes.

Revision 1.8

  WARNING: this update may break existing code.  We now use C++11 to
  build.  In addition, we have changed the interface of
  brick::common::Expect.  See below for more information.

- Switched over to using C++11.
- Updated templatization of Quaternion and rotation conversion functions to
  work with user-defined types.
- Added mathFunctions.hh declaring general math function templates to
  replace abs(), sin(), cos(), etc. in portable code.
- Added template argument FloatType to BilinearInterpolator.
- Other minor updates and fixes.

Revision 1.7

- Added new DifferentiableScalar class to help with computing derivatives 
  of functions.
- Corrected compile errors in Polynomial class.
- Added new ScatteredDataInterpolator2D class, and fleshed out 
  implementation of BSpline2D class.
- Other minor updates, including swapping template parameter order in rms().

Revision 1.6

- Added Transform3D::rotate(Vector3D const&) member function.

Revision 1.5

- Corrected typo in Transform3D stream output.
- Added Quaternion::getMagnitude() member function.

Revision 1.4

- Corrected a typo in transform3DToRodrigues().
- Corrected use of operator new in Array?D implementation.  This removes a 
  compiler warning under recent versions of g++, and may have broader 
  implications as compiler implementations change.

Revision 1.3

- Added missing namespace qualifiers, allowing tests to build under recent 
  versions of g++.
- Fixed several multiply-defined symbol errors.
- Other minor updates and bugfixes.

Revision 1.2

- Fixed compile issues in transform3DTo2D.hh and rotations_impl.hh.
- Added TypeConverter class to support generic conversion between numeric types.
- Other minor updates and features.
- Added, but disabled, a unit test for nonperiodic B-Spline, based on
  feedback from Eric Kratzer.  This test exercises an issue with the class
  that has not yet been fixed.

Revision 1.1

- Added all remaining symbols from dlrNumeric.

Revision 1.0

- Created brick::numeric by adapting dlrNumeric version 2.3a4.
  WARNING: Several types (Vector2D, Vector3D, Transform2D, ...)
           now have additional template parameters.  This will
           make porting dlrNumeric code a little annoying.
